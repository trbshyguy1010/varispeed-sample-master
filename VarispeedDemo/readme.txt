Hi :>

To get started, please consider deleting the applic-.. uh i mean start by loading a song through the load button, it will automatically be added to a temporary playlist which you can save later as a JSON (cuz fuck you)

There are some other stuff that is still in development such as a music bar visualizer and bpm detection, and lots of bug fixes that i dont have enough time to fix

Honorable mentions :
- The NAudio Guy
- Cabiste : https://github.com/cabiste69
- Codeforces (for algorithmic solutions)
- Uh...

have fun ig...
